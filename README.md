# ASHRAE Energy Prediction: 


### About:
This project aims to predict the Energy Consumption of different buildings given the past meter readings using Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

This project is inspired by the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction) organized by The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

### Downloading the dataset: 
We use Kaggle API to download the dataset. Therefore, you will need a Kaggle account and an API Token. 

* To generate the Token, please go to your Kaggle Profile -> Account -> Create new Token.
* Upload or move the “kaggle.json” file to your working directory.

By following those instructions, you should be able to download the data and run the notebook without any problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Code and current progress: 
In the following notebook, we load the data provided by ASHRAE. Then we take a look at the provided files to gain a deeper understanding of the problem.
We preprocess the data, reduce the memory requirements, and conduct features engineering. 
Additionally, we visualize the data and examine the correlation between the different variables.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Future Work
Note: This is the first submission! The next steps include data clustering and building the LSTM and GAN Networks to predict energy consumption.
